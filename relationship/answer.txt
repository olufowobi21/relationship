A gymnasium can have multiple members registered, but a member can only register at one gymnasium.

Explanation:

The Gymnasium entity represents the physical locations where members can register and attend sessions.
The Member entity represents the individuals who register at a gymnasium to attend sessions.
The Session entity represents the scheduled events led by coaches, where members can participate.
The Coach entity represents the individuals who lead sessions.
The relationships between entities are established based on the information provided, ensuring that each entity is connected to others in a meaningful way.
This Entity Relationship Model provides a solid foundation for designing a database that can efficiently manage the gym chain's clients, sessions, and coaches.
